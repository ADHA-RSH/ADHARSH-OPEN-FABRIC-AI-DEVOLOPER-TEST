# ADHARSH-OPEN-FABRIC-AI-DEVOLOPER-TEST
ðŸ§  Transform text prompts into AI-generated images and 3D models using Openfabric apps. The system enhances input, generates visuals, logs history, and supports local, Docker, and API executionâ€”showcasing a smart, memory-based AI pipeline.
ðŸ’¼ Job Description: AI Application Developer â€“ Openfabric Challenge
We are seeking a highly motivated AI Application Developer to build and deploy an end-to-end AI-powered pipeline using Openfabricâ€™s composable app ecosystem. This role centers around designing a system that transforms natural language prompts into AI-generated images and 3D models, while also maintaining a memory log of interactions.

ðŸ§  Responsibilities
Prompt Processing & Enhancement
Accept natural language prompts and optionally refine or preprocess them using mock LLM techniques.

Integration with Openfabric Apps
Use Openfabric APIs to:

Convert enhanced text into images (Text-to-Image App)

Generate 3D models from images (Image-to-3D App)

Pipeline Orchestration
Chain multiple AI services into a seamless workflow, ensuring output from one service feeds correctly into the next.

Memory System Implementation
Log each prompt and its outputs into a persistent file (memory.json) to simulate stateful behavior.

Deployment & Execution
Provide scripts and configurations for:

Local development (start.sh)

Docker-based deployment (Dockerfile)

API interaction via Swagger UI

Code Quality & Structure
Follow modular, readable code practices. Use schema definitions (InputClass, OutputClass, ConfigClass) for consistency with Openfabric standards.

Documentation & Submission
Prepare comprehensive README, sample output files, and submission materials for GitHub deployment and challenge entry.

âœ… Skills Required
Python (Core language for backend logic)

RESTful API integration

Docker (for containerized deployment)

JSON handling & file I/O

Familiarity with AI/ML workflows

Basic understanding of 3D file formats (.glb)

ðŸ“ˆ Outcome
A fully functional, documented AI pipeline capable of turning simple prompts into rich visual and 3D contentâ€”with persistent memory and multi-platform deployment support.
